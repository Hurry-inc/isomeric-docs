Behind every request is a powerful LLM trained on billions of tokens of website data. Every JSON value you request is a prompt to our LLM. Please read the [prompting](./prompting) section for more details on the prompt design.

## Expectations
The Isomeric LLM has a few gotchas that should be understood before diving into prompt design.

### Speed
There are two distinct tasks behind every request you make to Isomeric. Content retrieval and parsing.

Content retrieval means loading a website, waiting for javascript to load, parsing its content, and returning it. This speed can vary depending on the website being acted on and the level of anti-scraping measures used. Expect anywhere between 2 and 10 seconds to be spent here.

Next is parsing. This is where LLM prompting comes into the equation. We perform at least one (sometimes two) full passes through our multi-billion parameter model for every JSON value you request. We've gone to great lengths to make this lighting fast; however, the more values you request and the more tokens for each value, the slower this will be. A simple single token string can be produced in less than 100 milliseconds, and it can take several seconds to produce a list.

Furthermore, adding the [pattern](./prompting#pattern) attribute can significantly slow down response times, whereas [options](./prompting#options) can significantly speed them up.

### Quality
The quality of Isomeric output is only as good as the quality of your input. Please read the [prompting](./prompting) section to help design the best prompts.

If you'd like to verify the quality of the output, you can access the raw request content by passing `?content=true` in the request URL and the raw result of the content retrieval step will be returned to you.
