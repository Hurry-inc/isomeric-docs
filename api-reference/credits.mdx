## Request Costs

All Isomeric API calls cost **1 credit**. If a request fails because of an internal error, no credits will be charged.

## Purchasing Credits

Credits may be purchased in packs using the payment URLs returned from the [GET /credits](/endpoints/credits) endpoint (which itself does not cost any credits to call.)
